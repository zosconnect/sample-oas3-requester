# OpenAPI 3 API requester Sample
A sample z/OS Connect API requester project showing how to call an OAS3 defined API from a CICS COBOL, CICS PLI, a standalone COBOL application or a standalone PLI application.

## Introduction
This Redbook API requester sample implements a very simple IBM Redbook information application written in Java and hosted in Liberty. This application implements an OpenApi 3.0 described API. See the Sub Gradle project `RedbookApi` redbookapi.yaml file for a full description of the operations.  For a PLI usage please use RedbookApiPLI.

This project's gradle build will build the remote endpoint RedbookAPI application war file and also generate the z/OS Connect API requester war files for COBOL and PLI.

## Instructions
Follow the instructions in the [IBM Documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos-connect/zos-connect/3.0?topic=gst-creating-cics-cobol-zos-connect-api-requester-application) for details on how to build, deploy and run this tutorial sample.

## Structure
* The `COBOL` directory contains the CICS COBOL program BAQHRBKC.cbl and the standalone COBOL application BAQHRBKZ.cbl.
* The `COPY` directory contains example COBOL copybooks generated by building the RedbookApi requester project.
* The `CSD` directory contains the CICS CSD file BAQHRBKD.csd necessary for configuring the CICS COBOL program to CICS.
* The `deploy/api` directory contains the sample server.xml for a Liberty server installed with z/OS Connect. This runs the z/OS Connect API requester WAR and the Redbook endpoint application WAR.
* The `INCLUDE` directory contains example PLI copybooks generated by building the RedbookApiPLI requester project.
* The `PLI` directory contains the CICS PLI program BAQHRBKC.pli and the standalone PLI application BAQHRBKZ.pli.
* The `RedbookApi` directory contains the API requester Gradle sub-project, called from the outer Gradle build file.
* The `RedbookApi/src/main/api` directory contains the OpenAPI document, redbookapi.yaml, that describes the endpoint API application.
* The `RedbookApi/src/main/config` directory contains	the options.yaml file used to control how the redbookapi.yaml file is processed to produce a z/OS Connect API requester WAR file.
* The `RedbookApiPLI` directory contains the API requester Gradle sub-project, called from the outer Gradle build file.
* The `RedbookApiPLI/src/main/api` directory contains the OpenAPI document, redbookapi.yaml, that describes the endpoint API application.
* The `RedbookApiPLI/src/main/config` directory contains	the options.yaml file used to control how the redbookapi.yaml file is processed to produce a z/OS Connect API requester WAR file.
* The `src/main/java/com/ibm/zosconnect/redbook/app` directory contains the RedbookApp Java class that implements a JAX-RS Application for the endpoint application.
* The `src/main/java/com/ibm/zosconnect/redbook/model` directory contains the Java classes that represent the OAS schemas from redbookapi.yaml.
* The `src/main/java/com/ibm/zosconnect/redbook/resource` directory contains the Java classes used to implement the operations defined in redbookapi.yaml.
* The `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF` directory contains the web.xml file required for the Redbook endpoint application.

## RedbookAPI operations
### getAllRedbooks
Path **/redbooks**. Method **GET**. Passes an optional author query parameter of type string and expects an array of Redbook objects for a **200** response.

### getRedbook
Path **/redbook/{bookName}**. Method **GET**. Passes a title path parameter, and optional author query parameter and optional documentType header parameter. A Redbook object is returned for a **200** response. For a **404 (Not Found)** response a RedbookNotFound object is returned containing a message. A **500** for media type **text/plain** with a string schema.

### createRedbook
Path **/redbook/{bookName}**. Method **POST**. Passes a bookName path parameter and a Book object body. Expects a Book object for a **2XX** wildcarded response. A **409 (Conflict)** can also be returned. No other default responses are defined.

## Application Component Schemas
### Redbooks
An array schema type with items as the Redbook schema.

### Redbook
An object schema with properties relating to IBM Red Book metadata.

### RedbookNotFound
A simple object schema with a String message used to denote a Redbook is not found and an array of Redbook objects that the supplied author has written.

## CICS Resources
### BAQHRBKC CICS COBOL or PLI program
The CICS COBOL program BAQHRBKC.cbl, or the CICS PLI program BAQHRBKC.pli is called for three transactions that then call the three different operations on the remote API endpoint.

### CICS CSD BAQHRBKD
A CSD update file to define the Transactions and Program definitions into group BAQHRBKG.

## Standalone Resources
### BAQHRBKZ COBOL or PLI program
The COBOL program BAQHRBKZ.cbl, or the PLI program BAQHRBKZ.pli can call one of the three RedbookAPI operations depending on the operation short code (GARB, GRBK or CRBK) passed to the program as a PARM value via JCL.
